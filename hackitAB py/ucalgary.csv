Zoology ,401,An Introduction to Invertebrate Zoology ,"Natural history and diversity of invertebrates, which include sponges, corals, jellyfish, snails, octopus, insects, crustaceans, sea stars, and various worms. Emphasis on how free-living and parasitic organisms feed, move, reproduce, and survive in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats."
Zoology  ,403,An Introduction to Vertebrate Zoology ,"Systematics, natural history and biology of vertebrates, including fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. Laboratory work will emphasize the identification and morphology of native taxa as well as basic techniques of biological systematics."
Zoology ,435,Entomology,"Introduction to the insects, with emphasis on diversity, evolution, structure/function relationships, behaviour, and ecology."
Zoology ,461,Animal Physiology I,"Study of control mechanisms in nerves, sensory organs, muscles and endocrine glands."
Zoology ,463,Animal Physiology II,"Study of body fluids and hemostasis, body defence systems, reproductive physiology, respiration, circulation, excretion, gastrointestinal physiology and thermoregulation."

Zoology,530,Honours Research Project in Zoology,"Research project under the co/direction of faculty members in the Department of Biological Sciences. Original and independent thought, practical research, and written and oral reports presented on completion of this course. Open only to Honours Zoology students or Honours Biological Sciences students."
Zoology,567,Animal Behaviour,Offered from an evolutionary and ecological perspective. Development of ethological ideas; interaction of genotype and environment in ontogeny of behaviour; role of behaviour in dealing with environmental challenges.
Zoology,571,Palaeobiology of Vertebrates,"Evolutionary trends in the major groups of vertebrates from both neontological and palaeontological viewpoints. The interpretation of palaeontological data and their applicability to our understanding of evolution, systematics and palaeoecology."
Zoology,576,The Invertebrates ,"Collaborative research experience in invertebrate zoology, with emphasis on discovering, describing, and classifying diversity using zoological collections, systematic theory, and phylogenetic methods."
Zoology,577,Mammalogy,"A detailed examination of the evolution, morphology, physiology, ecology and behaviour of mammals."
Zoology  ,581,Principles in Parasitism ,"An introduction to parasitism. Topics include: host-parasite interactions, life-cycles, evolution and societal concerns. There is a focus on current research into these topics."
Zoology,595,Evolutionary Perspectives in Neurobiology ,"Explores form, function and performance of invertebrate and vertebrate neurons and nervous systems through examination of physical, biochemical, metabolic, (neuro)physiological and behavioural constraints and trade-offs. "
Zoology,597,Principles of Endocrinology,"General and molecular aspects of endocrine physiology. Topics will include the mechanisms of hormone action (receptor occupancy and transduction of signal), current techniques in endocrinology, synthesis and release of hormones, and the functional role of different endocrine organs. Lectures will include examples from lower vertebrates and invertebrates to emphasize comparative aspects."
Zoology,697,Advanced Topics in Comparative Endocrinology,"The principles of endocrinology will be provided through the lecture component of <a class=""link-text"" href=""zoology.html#6443"">Zoology 597</a>, and this will be augmented with additional reading, term papers and seminars in comparative endocrinology."
